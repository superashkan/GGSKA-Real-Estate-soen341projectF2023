Giancarlo:
- Implemented creation, search and deletion functions for properties which make use of our application's MongoDB database (3:00 PM - 12:00 AM (11/05/2023))
- Implemented functionality for editing properties in conjunction with our application's MongoDB database (10:00 AM - 11:30 AM (11/07/2023))
- Wrote acceptance tests for the user stories written for Sprint 2 (7:20 - 8:20 PM (09/07/2023))
- Implemented a very basic and incomplete (purely as a means of establishing a foundation) form for submitting an offer for the purchase of a property (9:00 - 10:30 PM (09/07/2023))
- (Many thanks to Ashkan) Performed additional work on the Profile and Brokers pages. Implemented the broker search algorithm. Allowed for the creation of broker-attributable properties, alongside updating and deleting such properties, as well as the editing of profile information, all from the broker profile. Allowed for visits to officially be scheduled. (3:00 PM - 12:30 AM (11/08/2023))
- Made it possible to differentiate between whether a created property is available for buying or renting, thus allowing for buyable and rentable properties to be displayed on their own designated pages ("Buy" and "Rent") which are accessible via the website's navigation bar. Allowed for scheduled visits for any property to be displayed on each property's information page (if at least one visit to such a property has been scheduled) (10:00 AM - 11:15 AM (11/09/2023))
- Made it possible for Internet-hosted images to be used alongside property entries in our database & which are shown on the website. Created a form which is designed to display information about any selected broker in a neat, larger format. Made it possible to view all properties associated with a certain broker. 1:05 - 2:20 PM (11/09/2023))
- Developed unit tests for a few helper functions and registration validation (2:40 - 3:50 PM (11/09/2023))
- Fixed a recurring error where submitting an edit form would result in an error (even after successfully performing a database entry update). Expanded upon the purchase offer submission form via adding required fields per Sprint 3 instructions. Fixed bugs where property image & buy/rental status were unable to be updated & were reset after attempting to edit a property's information. Fixed a bug where changing a property's address would no longer associate it with previously scheduled visits to it (10:05 AM - 12:50 PM (11/10/2023))
