# GGSKYA-Real-Estate

## Project Description
The project is a real estate web application for the search and the management of real estate properties. The application will have different features to make the real estate transactions more efficient.\
\
The web application will serve four types of users: homebuyers, property renters, system administrator(s) and real estate brokers.\
\
Homebuyers will be able to search for properties to buy, search for brokers and request visits to properties. They will also be able to use different criteria to search for properties. A mortgage calculator will also be put at their disposition to estimate the monthly payment of a property. \
\
Property renters will be able to look for lodgings (properties) to be rented. They will have access to the same features as homebuyers, except for the mortgage calculator. \
\
System administrator(s) will be able to add or remove brokers.\
\
Brokers will be able to manage their own property listings, and request visits to properties on behalf of their client(s). Brokers will also be able to make offers on the properties of other brokers.

## Project Approach: 
For the front-end of the website, we will be using HTML and CSS as our main tools. Hand in hand, these two languages can create stunning layouts for our real estate website. Alongside these base languages, we can introduce frameworks to enhance and facilitate our programming experience. One of these frameworks is called "React". Developed by Facebook, React provides reusability of components as well as a vast variety of developer tools. Additionally, it is one of the easiest front-end frameworks to learn & make use of. It is also great for creating interactive interfaces as it can reuse components. Another framework to keep in mind is called "Angular". Angular is slightly harder to learn then React, but it provides a framework that uses less code and has its own built-in two-way data binding. Lastly, another front-end framework we looked at was "jQuery". Used to make apps like Uber and Twitter (now known as X), it provides concise and simple code for developing desktop-based JavaScript applications. One problem is that this framework is quite dated and it is difficult for it to compete with new & faster frameworks that use less code. (Explain why we would use one of the three)

For the back-end, we will strictly be working with JavaScript alongside a back-end framework called "Node.js". Node.js can be used for generating dynamic page content, collecting form data, performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations on data in our database, and much more. As it uses JavaScript and can be used with our MySQL database, it will be relatively easy to learn and use. "Django" is another back-end framework that enhances development speed by focusing on reusing code. It runs off of the Python language and provides a quick & easy-to-use user experience. One more framework that we looked at but ultimatly passed on is the "Express.js" back-end framework. It utilizes JavaScript and it is built upon Node.js. Therefore, it adds more features while building apps. However, given the increased simplicity of Node.js compared to Express.js, how Node.js on its own is capable of providing the necessary functionality for our website, and our preference towards JavaScript as opposed to Python when it comes to a back-end programming language, we will be opting to not make use of Express.js or Django when it comes to creating the website.

As for our database, we will be using MySQL to store and update our data taken from the users of our website. This data will be manipulated by the back-end of the website with the use of "Node.js".
