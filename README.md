# GGSKYA-Real-Estate

## Project Description
The project is a real estate web application for the search and the management of real estate properties. The application will have different features to make the real estate transaction more efficient.\
\
The web application will serve four types of users: homebuyers, property renters, system administrator(s) and real estate brokers.\
\
Homebuyers will be able to search for properties to buy, to search for brokers and to request visits. They will also be able to use different criteria to search for properties. A mortgage calculator will also be put at their disposition to estimate the monthly payment of a property. \
\
Property renters look for lodgings to be rented. They have access to the same features as homebuyers, except the mortgage calculator. \
\
System administrator(s) will be able to add or remove brokers.\
\
Brokers will be able to manage their own property listings. Brokers will also be able to make offers on the properties of other brokers.
