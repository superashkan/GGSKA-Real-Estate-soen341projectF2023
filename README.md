# GGSKYA-Real-Estate

## Project Description
The project is a real estate web application for the search and the management of real estate properties. The application will have different features to make the real estate transaction more efficient.\
\
The web application will serve four types of users: homebuyers, property renters, system administrator(s) and real estate brokers.\
\
Homebuyers will be able to search for properties to buy, to search for brokers and to request visits. They will also be able to use different criteria to search for properties. A mortgage calculator will also be put at their disposition to estimate the monthly payment of a property. \
\
Property renters look for lodgings to be rented. They have access to the same features as homebuyers, except the mortgage calculator. \
\
System administrator(s) will be able to add or remove brokers.\
\
Brokers will be able to manage their own property listings. Brokers will also be able to make offers on the properties of other brokers.

## Project Approach: 
For the front-end of the website, we will be using HTML and CSS as our main tools. Hand in hand these two languages can create stunning layouts for our real estate website. Along side these base languages, we can introduce frameworks to enhance and facilitate our programming experience. One of these frameworks is called "React". Developed by Facebook, React provides reusability of components, vast variety of dev tools and it is one of the easist front-end frameworks. It is also great to create interactive interfaces as it can re-use components. Another framework to keep in mind is called "Angular". Angular is slightly harder to learn then react, but it provides a framework that uses less code and also has it's own in-built two-way data binding. Lastly, another front-end framework we looked at was "jQuery". Used to make apps like Uber and Twitter (now known as X), it provides concise and simple code for developing desktop-based javascript applications. One problem is that this framework is quite dated and it is hard for it to compete with new and faster frameworks that use less code. (Explain why would use one of the three)\

For the back-end we will strictly be working with JavaScript along side a back-end framework called "Node.js". Node.js can generate dynamic page content, it collect form data, it can add, delete and modify data in our database, as well as much more. As it uses JavaScript and can be used with our MySQL database, it will we relatively easy to learn and use. "Django" is another back-end framework that enhances development speed by focusing on reusing code. It runs of the Python language and it provides a quick and easy to use user experience. One more framework that we looked at but ultimatly passed on is the "Express.js" back-end framework. It utilizes JavaScript and it is built-upon Node.js, therefore it adds more features while building apps.
