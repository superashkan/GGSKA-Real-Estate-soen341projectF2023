# Wiki (for now, waiting on GitHub Student developer pack)


## Plan for next sprint:

For the next Sprint, we will have to start working on the front-end and back-end portions of our real estate website. The website layout, menus and simple functions must be developed & put in place before the arrival of Sprint 3.
In addition, we need to make sure that we have a usable database in order to move forward with the back-end programming.
Tools like searching for properties and submitting requests to visit properties should be done during Sprint 2. We will also develop the CRUD operations for the properties and brokers.

For the front-end, 1-2 weeks should be enough time to create a simple & full layout of the website and property pages.

For the back-end, 2-3 weeks of work should be a sufficient amount of time to work on the simple property search feature, the visit request feature and the CRUD operations.

For the database, we will be working with and on it at all times, as it is always being updated by the back-end developers.
