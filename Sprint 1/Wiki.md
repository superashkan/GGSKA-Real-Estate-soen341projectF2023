## Plan for next sprint:

For the next sprint, we will have to start working on our front-end and back-end. The website layout, menus and simple funtions must be put in place before the arrival of sprint 3. 
We need to make sure we have a usable database as well to move forward with the back-end programming. Tools like: searching for property and requests to visit properties should be done during sprint 2. 
We will also touch on the CRUD operations for the properties and brokers.

For the front-end, 1-2 weeks should be enough time to create a simple and full layout of the website and property pages. 

For the back-end, 2-3 weeks of work should be a sufficient amount of time to work on the simple property search, requests for visit feature and of course the CRUD operations.

For the database, we will at all times be working with and on it, as it is always being updated by the back-end devs.
