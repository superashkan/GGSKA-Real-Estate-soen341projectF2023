More on the structure of the code (folders for example)\
Follow the same naming convention everywhere, for example camel case everywhere

Version control files\
Keep two folders for front end and back end

Appendix C: Code review\
The person who implements the code. Then others need to check on their local machine that it does work. If there are anything missing, for example dependencies, there should be instructions to deal with that. 

Acceptance test cases: Necessary to test issues.\
Remember to close issues

When a feature that does not work as intended, you can add to the issue

Tools that we can use, mentioned in Sprint 4:\
Exlint for Javascript\
Stylelint for CSS

It will tell us about small analysis, for example variable that are not used.

You can install them and use them using a command line that mentions 

Run Sonarqube\
It will basically give you an overview of your project.\
Number of bugs and number of lines written\
You just need to know how to run it

For each folders, it will tell you how many bugs there are.\

Same rubric as before but two more things:
- Coding standard: how you write your code
- More clean and more managed, the better
- Data standards
- Demo: Website + code
- Necessary to show specific part of code and explain how it works
- Everyone needs to know what’s going on
- Folder structure
- Code review

main branch is the main branch, so it doesn’t matter for the other branches if they’re clean or not
test cases put folder there 

Make sure that you go through every points of the appendix
