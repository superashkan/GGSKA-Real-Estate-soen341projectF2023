We first thought to use Python, Django and Express.js for the backend, but the Lab TA proposed that Node.js is all that is necessary for the backend. The TA also mentioned that as we develop the app, we can decide to look into RESTful API. 

We ensured that any updates is also written in the Moodle private forum.

We also distributed the tasks between the team members for Sprint 2.

If possible, we plan to make the web app also available on mobile phones.
